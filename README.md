# College-Projects
Both of these python programs were projects of mine at college. These projects were created for an event called 'Tech Day' where we would showcase different projects.

Tamagotchi Program:
This was made by me and another college student. It essentially functions as a basic virtual pet, you can feed, clean, play and rest the character. The game in the play section is a random number game, if you guess the correct number you win.

Music Program:
This was made by me and is a GUI keyboard which shows the note played in music notation at the top. No sound unfortunately as I ran out of time.
